3. Proccess:
    1. The first game proccess - the first 30 second of the race are critical and can make very diffrence in the following of the game, by fishing more fish faster get give an andventage to the player and more speed.
    2. The core proccess of the game - to keep fishing while the race and change the position of the boat to get more speed using waves.
    3. The end process of the game - get the full speed at the end of the race end trying to get to the end of the line first, the end of the race are more difficult from the rest of the race because there is more better fishes that can give high speed and more big waves.
    * The way to control the boat is to use the arrows keys to change the boat position and using space key for fishing fish, when we fish a very big fish (for example a shark) - needed a couple of space key pressing to getting this shark, if the player will not press the space key fast enough in this situation the fish will fell from the fishing pole.
4. Rules:
    1. The player need to stay in the game border, if his boat will touch the border the boat will go slower, also, the game will limit the time per second that a player can using the fishing pole.
    2. The game results will by the end line of the race - the first boat to end the race will be the winner.

    2. The player will getting those fishes by using his fishing pole while the race.
6. Conflict:
    1. The main conflict of the player against the sea is by getting faster while the sea can get hard for the boat and can get it slower, that why the player need also to be in spesific position in the sea to not get harm by the sea waves.
    2. The main conflict between players is to winning the race while each boat get it's own powers by fishing while the race.
    3. The main conflict between the player and itself is to choose if he want to be in a good position for fishing better type of fishes and get more boat speed and powers but in the current positon getting currently slower because this position have a big waves and harsh sea condition.
7. Limits:
    1. The game map is limited by the race route in one direction (right).
    2. The game map is flat.
8. Results:
    1. The game can have two ending resutls - the first boat who get the end race line - wins, if the two boats getting the end line - the boat that get the higher scores in the game - wins, but if they two have the same score and get the race end line at the same time - this is a tie.
    2. The result depends both luck and better play - the boat that get better fishes while the race depends on the boat position in the sea and can make the boat faster but also the sea position condition can make the boats slower - this is why it's depends both on luck and better play of the player and his choises.
    3. The game is "sum zero" game - win of a player will make the other player lose the game.
